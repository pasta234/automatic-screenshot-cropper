# automatic-screenshot-cropper

An automatic screenshot cropper for apps like Instagram, Whatsapp, etc that removes the unnecessary garbage from your PNG file (written in Python).

It works by finding the first white line above/below the image and removing everything above/below it.



From this to that:
