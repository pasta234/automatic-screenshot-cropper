# automatic-screenshot-cropper

An automatic image cropper for apps like Instagram, Whatsapp, etc that removes the unnecessary garbage from your screenshot file (written in Python).

It works by finding the first white line above/below the central line of the .png file and removing everything above/below it.



From this to that:
